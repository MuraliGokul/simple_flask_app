Hey there ! This is Gokul Murali .
Please Note : This image should only be used for learning purposes ! 
I build this image while I was learning Dockerfiles . 
I wrote a Dockerfile to run a simple flask web framwork by :
1. Using Ubuntu OS base
2. Update the apt repositories
3. install python 3
4. install pip3 
5. Finally run the python3 app.py file
